# discord-image-trickery

A simple webapp to create images that display a different image in browser than what's displayed in discord.

## How does it work?

discord can't display animated pngs properly and instead only shows the first frame, most browsers on the other hand can so they will show the animation. 

## TODO 
- write the fucking code 
- think of a better name 
- dont be an idiot
